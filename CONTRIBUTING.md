## 🛡️ Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for all contributors. Be kind, constructive, and collaborative.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)
- Git installed on your machine

### Setup

1. **Fork** the repository using the GitHub Fork button (top-right of the repository page).

2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/student-task-manager.git
   cd student-task-manager
   ```

3. **Open the project** in your browser:
   ```
   Open index.html directly in your browser — no build step required!
   ```

4. **Add the upstream remote** to stay in sync:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Sejal10406/student-task-manager.git
   ```

---

## 🔄 Development Workflow

1. **Sync with upstream** before starting any new work:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create a dedicated branch** for your contribution:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   # or
   git checkout -b docs/your-doc-update
   ```

3. **Make your changes** — keep them focused on a single concern.

4. **Test your changes** by opening `index.html` in the browser and verifying:
   - Feature works as expected
   - No console errors
   - Responsive on mobile (resize window to < 480px)
   - LocalStorage keys persist state values correctly (verify via DevTools Application tab)

5. **Commit your changes** with a descriptive message (see below).

6. **Push your branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub against the `main` branch.

## 🧑‍💻 Coding Standards

Since this project uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

### HTML
- Use semantic elements (`<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, etc.)
- Include `alt` attributes on all images
- Use `aria-*` attributes for interactive elements without implicit roles

### CSS
- Follow the existing CSS variable system in `:root`
- Use `var(--variable-name)` instead of hardcoded colors
- Mobile-first: add responsive styles inside `@media (max-width: 480px)`

### JavaScript
- Use `const` and `let` — avoid `var`
- Keep functions small and single-purpose
- Add a JSDoc comment for non-obvious functions
- Avoid inline event handlers in JS-generated HTML where possible
